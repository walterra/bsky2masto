# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis for the latest released
version.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately by contacting the maintainer via GitHub Security
Advisories (preferred) or a direct private channel.

When reporting, include:

- affected version
- reproduction steps
- potential impact
- suggested mitigation (if available)

You can expect an acknowledgment within a few days and coordinated disclosure
once a fix is available.
